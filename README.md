# PixiBreakout
Breakout project created during a programming class I gave to work colleagues. Over 2 days, they learned javascript and the pixi.js library.
Not too bad of a start for people who did knew programming :)

Access the result here: https://uberyoji.github.io/PixiBreakout/

If you want to test locally, install node.hs and the http-server package.
Open command line then type: npm -g install http-server.
After you can use the localhost.bat file to launch a local server.

Enjoy.
